# AuthAPI for C#
*This project was made for the ThatAPICompany competition of September 2024.*

-------------------
This project is a C# SDK for the AuthAPI. It allows you to easily interact with the AuthAPI in your C# projects.
There is no external depedency needed to use this SDK as it was made using only standard C# libraries.

## Installation
Just add it to your project using NuGet:
```
dotnet add package AuthAPI
```
And you're good to go!

## Documentation
We don't have a documentation for the SDK yet available because the project is still in early developement. When we will have a documentation, it
will be available [here](https://software.dynwares.com/cs-auth-api/docs).]

From now on, you can check the [official documentation](https://authapi.com/docs) for more information on how to use the AuthAPI.
